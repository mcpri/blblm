Description: This package is able to find Linear Regression estimates and uses a Little Bag of Bootstrap.
    The sampling method is applied to the linear regression model, and is able to predictions, coeff, and confident intervals.
    What Little bag of Bootstrap means is that procedure which incorporates features of both the bootstrap and subsampling to yield a robust, 
    computationally efficient meansby the assessing the quality of estimators. Little Bag of Bootstrap is mostly used when doing modern parallel 
    and distributed computing architectures and furthermore retains the generic applicability and statistical efficiency of the bootstrap. Also 
    Linear regression is used in this package as well and it is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors.
